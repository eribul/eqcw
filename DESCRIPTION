Description: 
  Translations between different conuntryspecific EQ5D value sets and 
  summary statistics for patient-reported outcome measures: the improvement ratio. 
  Patient-reported outcomes measures (PROMs) can facilitate objective 
  comparisons of alternative treatments and can aid clinicians, researchers, 
  decision-makers and members of the general public in gauging different 
  healthcare providers' performance using a simple index, the improvement ratio. 
  This package includes methods for inference and null-hypothesis testing 
  of the improvement index in different groups or testing for trends.
